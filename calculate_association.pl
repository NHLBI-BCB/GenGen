=over 8

=item B<--help>

print a brief help message and exit

=item B<--man>

print the complete manual of how to use the program

=item B<--verbose>

use verbose output

=item B<--tdt>

=item B<--qt>

perform quantitative trait analysis using simple linear regression models

=item B<--output>

specify output root file name. When this argument is not set, the main 
association results will be written to STDOUT; when this argument is set, 
multiple output files will be generated containing detailed information for each 
marker and each individual.

=item B<--perfam>

print out detailed association evidence (transmission ratio in TDT or TSP tests) 
for each family for each marker (by default, the association test statistic is a 
summary of all families)

=item B<--snppropfile>

a file that specify properties for each marker, such as gene annotation, 
alternative name and so on. The property information will be printed in the 
association results in each line for each SNP marker to help annotate and 
interpret the association results.

=item B<--(no)flush>

this argument is on by default: it forces flushing input/output pipes after each 
read/write operation, so that one can monitor program progress in real-time (for 
example, when writting results to a file, or when running program via rsh or 
ssh). It presumably increase disk overhead so one can turn off this argument by 
--noflush: this is very important to do when running the program in parallel in 
many computers that share the same central storage!

=item B<--allmarker>

use all markers for analysis without exclusion criteria

=item B<--exclude>

specify one or several files that contains markers (one per line) that should be 
excluded from analysis.

=item B<--extract>

specify one or several files that contains markers (one per line) that should be 
used in analysis.

=item B<--geno_threshold>

genotype no-call rate threshold for inclusion of markers in analysis (if the 
marker has no-call rate equal to or less than this threshold)

=item B<--maf_threshold>

minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold for inclusion of markers in analysis (if 
the marker has MAF equal to or more than this threshold)

=item B<--mme_threshold>

marker mendelian error threshold for inclusion of markers in analysis (if for 
this marker, the fraction of trios/quartets with medelian inconsistencies is 
equal to or less than this threshold)

=item B<--hwe_threshold>

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium threshodl for inclusion of markers in analysis (if 
the marker has HWE P-values more than or equal to this threshold)

=item B<--mstart>

specify the first marker to analyze. Together with the --mend argument, these 
can be used to analyze only a subset of markers in the entire GT file, and is 
suitable to split the genome-wide analysis job into multiple parallele 
computers.

=item B<--mend>

specify the last marker to analyze. Together with the --mstart argument, these 
can be used to analyze only a subset of markers in the entire GT file, and is 
suitable to split the genome-wide analysis job into multiple parallele 
computers.

=item B<--cellsize>

minimum number of counts in each cell in the contingency table for chi2-based 
association test, including genotypic association test, dominant model 
association test, recessive model association test.

=item B<--allind>

use all individuals for analysis without exclusion criteria

=item B<--remove>

specify one or several files containing family and individual identifiers (one 
per line) to be removed from analysis

=item B<--keep>

specify one or several files containing family and individual identifiers (one 
per line) to be used in analysis

=item B<--mind>

specifying the missingness threshold (if the fraction of missing genotypes for 
all markers exceed this threshold, this individual is not uesd in analysis)

=item B<--fme_threshold>

family mendelian error threshold for inclusion of families in association 
analysis (if fraction of markers with Mendelian inconsistency in this family 
exceed this threshold, this family is not used in analysis). THIS ARGUMENT IS 
SET AS 1, AS IT IS NOT WELL-DEFINED YET. IF ONE OF TWO OFFSPRINGS IN A FAMILY 
HAVE EXCESSIVE MENDELIAN INCONSISTENCY, DO WE STILL INCLUDE THE OTHER GENUINE 
OFFSPRING IN ANALYSIS? OR DO WE COMPLETELY DISCARD THIS FAMILY? FME_THRESHOLD 
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE REALLY USEFUL HERE, COMPARED TO IME_THRESHOLD.

=item B<--ime_threshold>

individual mendelian error threshold for inclusion of individuals in association 
analysis (if fraction of markers with Mendelian inconsistency in this individual 
exceed this threshold, this individual is not used in analysis)

=item B<--alleleAB>

specify that the genotype calls in GT file are in AB alphabet, rather than ACGT alphabet.

=item B<--ab>

specify that the genotype calls in GT file are in AB alphabet, rather than ACGT alphabet.

=item B<--canonical_gtfile_format>

specify that the GT file is in canonical gtfile format, where in each line the 
first three tab-delimited columns are marker name, chromosome and position, and 
the rest columns are genotype calls for all individuals.

line represent markre name and the rest represent genotype calls for all 
individuals.

line of the file indicate the column index for Name, Chr, Position and GType for 
all individuals.

=item B<--affymetrix_gtfile_format>

(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) specify that the GT file is in Affymetrix data format, 
which is the output file from the Affymetrix Power Tools software. It will have 
multiple header lines starting with #, followed by the genotype calls. An 
optional --confidence file will be needed so that only highly confident SNP 
calls are used in analysis.

=item B<--plink_tpedfile_format>

specify that the GT file is in TFAM/TPED file format generated by the PLINK 
software. This options allows PLINK users to quickly use their existing data 
files for analysis by this program. (use the --recode --transpose option in 
PLINK to generate TFAM/TPED files).

=item B<--cycle>

specify the permutation cycle (default cycle=0, meaning no permutation is 
requested)

=item B<--seed>

specify the randomization seed (default seed=1). When running multiple 
permutations in multiple machines (for example, 100 permutations on each of 100 
machines, for a total of 1000 permutations), it is important to specify 
different seeds for differnet machines.

=item B<--perm_method>

permutation method for case-control study (1=allelic, 2=trend, 3=genotypic, 
4=dom, 5=rec): five different methods can be used to calculate association 
statistic for case-control studies, so we have to specify which method is used 
for calculation of permutated chi2 and P values. The default method is allelic 
association test.

=item B<--covfile>

specify an external file that contains covariates for each individual. The file 
contains tab-delimited records, with the first two columns in each line 
corresponding to family id and individual id, and the rest of the columns 
specifying covariates (binary trait or quantitative values). Missing values can 
be represneted as "NA" and individuals with missing values will be ignored in 
analysis.

=item B<--covcolumn>

specify that the covariates are all contained within the ped_header file itself, 
and give the column of these covariates. Multiple columns are separated by 
comma.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is used to perform genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to 
identify the possible association between genetic markers (such as single 
nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations) and one or more phenotypic 
measures (such as disease status or quantitative expression values). To learn 
more about GWA, the following papers are good general references:

diseases. Science 273:1516-1517

and complex traits, Nature Reviews Genetics 6, 95-108

Given a list of individuals, their pedigree relationships, and their 
phenotypes/covariates in a file called ped_header file, as well as genotypes for 
many genetic markers for each individual, this program will test the association 
of each marker with the primary phenotype (such as disease status) adjusting for 
other phenotypes (such as age and sex). Three kinds of testing strategies can be 
analyzed by this program: case-control study (with five different 
association/regression models) and family-based study with 
transmission/disequilibrium test, as well as trio/quartet based study with Tsp 
test (a preliminary form of the Pedigree Disequilibrium Test by Martin et al), 
for which the details were given in I<Tests for linkage and association in 
nuclear families> Am J Hum Genet. 1997 Aug;61(2):439-48 (PUBMED ID: 9311750).

The following sections will give more detailed descriptions on the program:


=head2 Section 1. =======================File formats==========================

=head3 B<ped_header file>

The ped_header file can be considered a superset of the normal PED file used in 
most genetic analysis. It is a tab-delimited text file that records information in one line 
for each individual, and the first six columns of the line are family id, 
individual id, father id, mother id, sex and affection status (or quantitative 
trait). The following columns can be other phenotypes or covariates or genotypes 
or any information (such as race, name, address, etc) one wants to include.

An example of the ped_header file is shown below:

	AU0215  AU021503        AU021502        AU021501        1       2	White	AA

	AU0285  AU028505        AU028502        AU028501        2       1	Unknown	AB
	AU0285  AU028501        0       0       2       1	White	AA
	AU0285  AU028503        AU028502        AU028501        2       2	White	BB
	AU0285  AU028502        0       0       1       1	White	AB
	AU0121  AU012104        AU012102        AU012101        2       2	White	AB

In addition to the first 6 columns seen in a typical PED file, there is two 
extra columns: one specifying race, and the other specifying the genotype of a 
SNP marker. These two extra columns can be covariates in association analysis. 
Many more additional columns can be added in the file following the first 6 
columns; therefore, it is even possible to use a regular PED file containing all 
SNP genotypes as a ped_header file!

Note that for binary trait, missing phenotypes can be represented as 0; but for 
quantitative trait, it should be represented as B<NA>.

=head3 B<GT file>

The GT file is a genotype file that contains information for one marker per 
line. In a canonical GT file, the first three columns for the file are markerid, 
chromosome and position, while the following columns contain the genotypes for 
each individual. The format for the GT file can be slightly relaxed by the --
illumina_gtfile_format and --affymetrix_gtfile_format arguments. In the case of 
Illumina GT file, one can simply export selected columns in the FullDataTable 
from the BeadStudio software as a GT file, without conforming to the strict 
criteria for a canonical GT file; instead, the definition of columns can be read 
from the first line of the GTfile.

To explain this in more detail, see the first 10 lines of a canonical GT file 
below:

Each line contains 10 tab-delimited columns, and the first three columns are 
general description of the SNP marker, while the rest columns are the genotypes of 
the markers.

As you can see, the column position I<Name>, I<Chr> and I<Position> columns are 
determined by the first line (so-called header line of GT file), and the 
genotype for each marker is also determined by the ***.GType column in the 
header line. In other words, the Illumina-GTfile can contain much more 
information than a canonical GTfile, as long as the header line contains enough 
informatoin for identifying the required columns.

Missing genotypes can be specified as B<NC>, B<-->, B<00> or B<0>.

=head3 B<TFAM/TPED file>

To facilitate PLINK users to use this program, the user can alternatively 
generate the TAFM/TPED file in PLINK and feed them into the program.

For example, suppose you have three PLINK files in binary format as input.bim, 
input.fam and input.bed. First it is necessary to transform the files to 
TAFM/TPED text-based format in PLINK:

	plink --bfile input --out output --transpose --recode

Two files including output.tfam and output.tped will be generated.

You can then use the --plink_tpedfile_format argument in this program to read in 
the output.tfam and output.tped file.

=head3 B<Simple-format GT file>

The simple file format is similar to the GT file above, with the exception that 
there is no Chr and Position column in the file. To use simple-format GT file, 
the user needs to specify the --simple_format argument to the program.

This file can be easily generated from Illumina BeadStudio report file format, 
or Affymetrix BRLMM/BirdSeed output file format, or Affymetrix Chiamo fs file 
format, with some very simple one-line Perl programming.

=head3 B<output files>

The main output file will be the association results. When --output argument is 
not set, the association results will be printed to STDOUT (standard output, 
typically terminal screen). Otherwise, the association results will be written 
to the file specified by --output argument.

Many I<NOTICE> and I<WARNING> message will be printed during the program run, 
which gives intermediate notification of the progress of the program, as well as 
possible minor problems encountered. when the --output argument is set, these 
messages will be also written to a log file $output.log.

An additional marker information file will be generated. This file contains 
detailed information for each marker, including allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium test and so on. This is a text file too with one marker per line, 
but with many more columns than the association results file, and contains 
information for all markers (including markers not passing MAF, HWE and MME 
thresholds).

For example, the first 10 lines of a minfo file is given below:

When family information is available, the finfo file will contain the following information:

	family_id       num_analyzed_marker     mendelian_error_count   mendelian_error_rate

When some samples are recommended to be removed (due to call rate, Mendelian 
error, etc), they will be written to a remove file.


=head2 Section 2. ===================Testing strategy==========================

=over 8

=item * B<Case-control association test>

Case-control association test compared two phenotype groups with a binary label, 
such as disease status. There are typically five differnet models to test the 
association of binary phenotypes with bialleleic genotypes, which are briefly 
described below:

1. Genotypic association test (2df association test)

The genotypic association test, also referred to as 2df (2 degrees of freedom) 
associaiton test, uses 2X3 contingency table to test the association between 
binary phenotype label with a trinary genotype label (AA, AB and BB). This is a 
standard chi2 test; however, caution should be exercised where cells in the 
contingency tables are small (less than 5): P-values in this case might be 
inflated or deflated. Typically, when sample size is sufficiently large (>2000) 
and when alleles are relatively common (MAF threshold is set to >1%), this is 
rarely the case. The --cell_size argument can be used to specify the minimum 
cell: the marker will be excluded from association test if any one of the six 
cells in the contingency table is less than 5.

In rare cases, one type of genotypes might be completely absent from the 2X3 
contingency table in both case group and control group. In this case, the 
genotypic association test uses a 2X2 table and has one degree of freedom now.

2. Allelic association test

The allelic association test compares the allele frequency between case groups 
and control groups, using a chi2 test.

3. Cochran-Armitage trend test

The Cochran-Armitage trend association test essentially tries to reduce the 2df 
in genotypic association test to 1df, by assuming an additive mode of 
inheritance. It is conceptually identical to a logistic regression, where 
dependent variables are disease status, and independent variables are genotypes. 
For more information see Armitage, P (1955). Tests for linear trends in 
proportions and frequencies. Biometrics, 11:375-386.

4. Dominant model association test

The dominant model treat AB and BB as the same label (B allele has dominant 
effect over A), and then test the association of binary phenotype labels with 
binary genotype labels. Note that some other software (such as PLINK) may use 
minor/major allele to specify a dominant model, but here we always assume that B 
has dominant effect over A. This test is affected by the --cellsize argument: 
when cells in contingeny table is smaller than the --cellsize argument, the 
association chi2 and P values will be reported as I<NA>.

5. Recessive model association test

The recessive model treat AA and AB as the same label (B allele has recessive 
effect), and then test the association of binary phenotype labels with binary 
genotype label. Note that some other software (such as PLINK) may use 
minor/major allele to specify a recessive model, but here we always assume that 
B has recessive effect over A. This test is affected by the --cellsize argument: 
when cells in contingeny table is smaller than the --cellsize argument, the 
association chi2 and P values will be reported as I<NA>.

=item * B<Transmission/disequilibrium test>

The transmission/disequilibrium test examine the over-transmission of a 
particular allele from heterozygous parents to their offsprings. Strictly 
speaking, for complex diseases, as we always assume that disease phenotype is 
linked with every gene, we are using TDT to test for association only. 
Therefore, the TDT test can be only applied to father-mother-offspring trios in 
GWA studies. (However, some groups do not agree with this point, and use TDT on 
quartet and extended families as well to test for association.)

To know more about the TDT test, see the original publication Spielman RS, 
McGinnis RE, Ewens WJ.Transmission test for linkage disequilibrium: the insulin 
gene region and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). AJHG 52:506-16 
(1993).

To read more about using TDT in genome-wide association studies, see Ewens WJ, 
Spielman RS. What is the significance of a significant TDT? Hum Hered. 60:206-10 
(2005). Note that some groups apparently do not agree on the main point of this 
paper; and that PLINK does not perform any adjustment for multiplex families. I 
myself have performed simulation study and demonstrated that in the case of 
multiplex families, TDT gives inflated type I error, and results in loss-of- 
power (this is not published and will not be published, it is for my own fun). 
If you have quartets, the TSP (see below) but not TDT, is a valid test, and 
shows correct type I error and improved power. For general pedigrees, there are 
several other programs for association tests, including FBAT, LAMP and so on, 
but they are generally slow and do not scale up to genome-wide association 
studies well.

=item * B<TSP test>

The TSP test is named after Martin et al. I basically used a highly similar 
model as they have used, with one exception (slight modification). This 
exception potentially decrease the power of the method, but I can never 
understand their original pseudo-counting method in their paper. I think it is 
just fine to use equal pseudocounts for A and B alleles when there is ambiguity 
in transmission status, in that the power loss is generally negligible.

=item * B<quantitative trait analysis>

This program also implements a simple regression model for quantitative trait 
analysis. In the regression model, the dependent variable is the QT, while the 
independent variable is the genotypes (AA=0, AB=1 and BB=2). The association 
test is testing the null hypothesis that the slope of the regression is zero. 
Note that in this regression model, we are assuming an additive model for B 
alleles. If one wants to use a multiplicative model, one has to manually convert 
the QT values to logarithm scale in the ped_header file, before running this 
program.

=back

=head2 Section 3. ===========================Quality control===================

Genotype quality control (QC) is an important step for genetic association 
analysis, and may help eliminate spurous association or improve power to detect 
true associations.

Two types of exclusion/inclusion thresholds are implemented in this program: one 
types of QC operates on per-marker level, and the other type of QC operates on 
per-individual level. Unlike other programs (such as PLINK) that does both QC 
steps semi-simultaneously, this program treat these two types of QC differently.

The program scans each line in the GT file sequentially to test for associatoin 
for each marker; therefore, the per-marker level QC is performed during the 
scanning step: markers that fail to meet the --geno_threshold, --maf_threshold, 
--mme_threshold and --hwe_threshold are not printed to association results 
(however, these information for all markers are written to the minfo file so 
that you can check the exact values for these excluded markers).

After the initial scanning step, we would also get a count of the --
ime_threshold, --fme_threshold, --mind and can test whether some indiviudals 
failed to meet these threshold. The individuals that did not meet the per-
individual QC criteria are written to a file as *.indremove.

Therefore, the per-individual level QC is performed after scanning the entire GT 
file. Since all the marker statistics were calculated using all the individuals, 
one must use the --remove argument to add this *.indremove file to the command 
line and re-run the program again to get the correct association results. (Note 
that you can specify the --remove argument in command line multiple times, and 
information from all the --remove arguments will be combined together for 
removing individuals)

The whole process sounds a little weird, but it does make a lot of sense to do 
this in a two-step way. In summary, we use the per-marker scanning to identify 
individuals that fail to meet QC criteria (the criteria is calculated using only 
a set of markers that pass the per-marker QC criteria), and then remove these 
individuals to calculate the final association results.

Several additional notes are described below:
 
=over 8

=item * B<minor allele fequency (MAF)>

The minor allele frequency is calculated on founders only! Founders refers to 
individuals without father and mother annotations in the ped_header file. Note 
that if an individual has father and mother annotation in the ped_header file, 
but such father and mother do not exist in the ped_header file, this individual 
is not treated as founder. (this usually happens when some indivduals in family-
based study do not have DNA samples or are not genotyped.) A warning message 
will be printed out to STDERR during the pedigree structure inspection step.

For male chrX and chrY, if the genotype is heterozygotes, it is treated as 
NoCall instead; otherwise, it contribute one count to the total allele count (as 
opposed to two for female chrX).

Female chrY is ignored in MAF calculation.

For case-control studies, the allele frequency is calculated by pooling cases 
and control together, and stored in the *.minfo file when the --output argument 
is set. However, in the association results, the case allele frequency and 
control allele frequency are also printed.

=item * B<Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)>

The HWE calculation uses exact test. See Wigginton JE, Cutler DJ, Abecasis GR, A 
Note on Exact Tests of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. AJHG, 76: 887-93 (2005) for 
more details.

The HWE is calculated only for autosomes, and for female chrX. Other chromosome 
will be assigned a HWE value of NA.

Similar to MAF, the HWE is calculated on founders only! For case-conrol studies, 
again the HWE is calculated using combined samples. This may cause some 
problems, since one may argue that cases should violate HWE in markers that are 
associated with disease status. In the future, an argument will be added that 
change this default behavior and only calculate HWE on controls to eliminate 
such concerns.

=back

=head2 Section 4. ================Advanced usage of the program================

Although the program was originally written for simple association analysis, 
over time it has evolved into a testing platform for implementing various 
analytical strategies beyond simple chi2 based association test. Below I briefly 
describe several advanced usage of the program that are still in experimental 
phase.

=over 8

=item *B<using remove, keep, exclude and extract files>

The program can accept the same types of remove, keep, exclude and extract files 
as used by the PLINK software, so that one can conveniently specify a subset of 
samples or a subset of markers to be used in association analysis. In addition, 
it is possible to specify multiple files separated by comma in the command line, 
which is something that is not available in the PLINK software; this behavior of 
using multiple filter files has some advantage in practical settings.

=item * B<parallel execution of association test>

The program was mainly implemented in Perl: speed-wise, its performance is not 
satisfactory. Although considerable amounts of bits of the program will be 
gradually transferred to C subroutines, sometimes it is still desirable to 
parallelize the program to achieve fast speed. Generally speaking, it takes only 
a few hours to perform association test on 3000 subjects on 550K markers. 
However, if testing association on 10,000 subjects, the time would be much 
longer and it may be desirable to split the job into multiple subset of jobs and 
run them in different computers in parallel.

At this moment, an easy-to-implement strategy for parallelization is through the 
--mstart and --mend argument, which specify the index of the first marker and 
last marker to include in analysis (the index starts from 1 and end at the last 
marker included in GT file).

For example, to analyze 500K markers in 10 machines/CPUs, one can execute the 
following commands in different machines separately:

	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out part1 -mstart 1 -mend 50000
	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out part2 -mstart 50001 -mend 100001
	...
	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out par10 -mstart 450001 -mend 500000

All the output files (excluding LOG file) can be concatenated together easily, 
since they are all line-based file. The above steps can achieve considerable 
speed increase.

Certainly, one could also generate 10 marker files each containing 50K markers 
and then use the --extract argument for each marker file in 10 different 
machines. One could also line-split the GT file to 10 part, but add one extra 
header line to all files except the first one, then run the program on all of 
them. There are many ways for easy parallelization, but the --mstart and --mend 
seem to be the easiest way.

=item * B<parallel permutation procedure>

The permutation procedure takes much longer than than simple association test. 
Therefore, it is generally a good idea to split the total cycle of requested 
permutations (such as 1000) to different computer nodes (for example, use --
cycle 100 for each of 10 computational nodes). Since the default randomization 
seed is set to 1 in the program, do make sure to use a different seed in each 
different machine!

	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out part1 -seed 1 -cycle 100 -noflush
	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out part2 -seed 2 -cycle 100 -noflush
	...
	calculate_association.pl pedheaderfile GTfile -cc -out par10 -seed 10 -cycle 100 -noflush

In the above command, we specify a different randomizatoin seed for each 
command, and each command perform 100 permutation cycles. Note that the 
--noflush argument is added to the command line, which ensures that input/output 
are NOT flushed during each read/write operation. This is especially important 
when doing parallel computation, to decrase the system overhead on hard disks.

=item * B<Adjusting for co-variates>

Adjusting for co-variates is NOT IMPLEMENTED due to lack of stimulus/incentive. 
Basically for case-control studies, this implicates that logistic regression 
should be used to incorporate co-variate information. For quantitative trait 
analysis, this implicates that standard multiple linear regression should 
suffice.
